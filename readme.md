# Eric Android Learning

Welcome to the learning repo for Eric

The project has 2 apps
- SamsModule
- EricsModule

Sam will keep on adding functionality to the app in his module and Eric can look at the code and copy it so it can be used for his app.

Below are the tasks to complete in order to make a functioning android app. I will update the tasks when you need more.
