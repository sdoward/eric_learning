## Task 5 - RecyclerView

### Objective - Use recyclerview to make the visuals look nicer

### Steps to complete
1. Add recyclerview dependency to `build.gradle
2. Create an xml layout file which will display data for each beer
3. Create a RecyclerView Adapter
4. Get a reference to the recycler view in `MainActivity`
5. Add a `LayoutManager` and your adapter to the recyclerview once the data has been loaded from the server

Look at MainActivity, BreweryAdapter and brewery_item.xml too see how I achieved this. You don't need to copy my layout exactly. Try and make a design yourself
