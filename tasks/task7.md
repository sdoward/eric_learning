## Git branching and Pull Requests

Git is a very powerful tool to share and review code. It can be used in my ways in order for people to collaborate on projects. Until now we have used it in the most simple way. 

Typically when working with a team of developers you are required to use pull requests (also referred to a PR). A PR is basically a way to share your code so others can give you feedback and opportunity to change before you push/merge that code to the main code base. This enables for better code quality (others check it) and allows developers to align and the way they make apps. 

In order to make a pull request you need to understand a little about git branching. A branch is basically a way to have a different versions of the code base at the same time. Branches are typically used when doing new work, a feature, a bug fix etc. Branches can be shared by pushing then from your local repo to the remote repo.

### Objective

Make some changes to your code and open a PR. Sam will review and then you can merge it when it's been approved.  

### Steps to complete

1. Create a new branch. This should be named in a way that describes the work that will be done.
2. Make some changes to your code. This can be anything you like. Change some text styles, add more data to the ui etc.
3. Commit those changes to the new branch.
4. Publish that branch to github (publishing a branch is like pushing a commit)
5. Go to https://github.com/sdoward/eric_learning and you should see a button asking if you want to open a Pull Request. Click it and open the pull request
6. Ask Sam to review it. 
7. Sam will give some comments and ask to change something (this is just practice)
8. Make changes to the code
9. Commit the changes to the same branch
10. Push that commit to github
11. Sam will review again with the new code and approve (hopefully)
12. Merge the changes to master branch, this can be done on github.com

We will follow this pattern for each of the following tasks. It will enable me to give you feedback in an easier way and you will get used to working with others.
