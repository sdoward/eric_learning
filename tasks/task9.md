## Task 9 - Getters, Setters and Access Modifiers

Originally when defining the Brewery and Beer class we did it in the most basic way. You have then added a constructor.
You then fixed the naming conventions. Now we will add getters and setters.

Getters and Setters do what they say. A setter sets data, a getter gets the data. 

Before we do that we need to introduce access modifiers. This video will help with the concept

### Objective

Add access modifiers to your data class and add the corresponding getters and setters

### Steps to complete
1. Add the private access modifier in Beer to every variable you have defined 
2. Add a getter and setter for each variable in the Beer class
3. Modify you BeerAdapter to use the getters instead of accessing variables directly
