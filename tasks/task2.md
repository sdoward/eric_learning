## Task 2 - Using git/github

In order for us to work on this project together we need to understand how to use github.

There will always be 3 versions of the code (also called a repo/repository)

1. Github repo: this is the main one that we will push changes to and pull changes from. If Sam pushes changes to github then Eric will have to pull them
2. Sams repo: only Sam sees this. If I want to make changes to the code then I make them on my local repo(on my computer). Once the changes are finished I push them to github. Eric can then pull them changes to his repo. 
2. Erics repo: only Eric sees this. If Eric wants to make changes to the code then he makes them on his local repo(on my computer). Once the changes are finished he pushes them to github. Sam can then pull them changes to his repo.

### Steps to complete
1. Make a change to your module. The easiest would be to change the text size in the file `activity_main.xml`
2. Use git to `commt` those changes locally. 
3. Use git to `push` those local changes to github
4. Tell Sam when this is completed. Sam will then pull, see your changes and make changes himself and push his changes.
5. Once Sam has pushed. You can then pull to see the changes he made.

Going forward we will use this pattern of pulling and pushing changes. It's not completely simple but it is something you have to learn.
